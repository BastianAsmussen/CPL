# CPL
Thank you to the [FreeCodeCamp Blog Post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-programming-language-pipeline-91d3f449c919/) for the inspiration!

I am going to be creating a programming language from scratch. I will be documenting my progress here.
I'll be following along with [this](https://hackernoon.com/building-your-own-programming-language-from-scratch) blog post to get started.

I'll be a compiled language, and I'll be using Rust to write the compiler.
